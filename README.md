Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client has a Android based game called "Draw It or Lose It". They would like to expand their user base by porting the game to other platforms. The Gaming Room client asked our company Creative Technology Solutions to evaluate various platforms before making their decision. 


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did well in the additional research I conducted into the various platforms the client wanted evaluated. Having multiple sources of different perspectvies allowed me to have clear recommondations that were backed from industry professionals. 


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Learning about design patterns and how to implement them was beneficial in developing the client requirements into the application. What was really benefical to my development of the application was utulizing different IDEs to write the code as some werent as robust as others (I'm now a fan of the IntelliJ IDEA). 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would have liked to included more information about cloud based services as I keep finding interesting information regarding the different platforms (Amazon, Microsoft, Google). I would have more in depth information on each and the benefits each one provides. I would have included pros and cons for each and maybe a more in depth cost analysis. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Its important to distinguish the user's needs from wants and order of importance (Must Have, Should have, likely, unlikely, not likely) through clear communication and collaboration from the client. As a developer, focusing on the user needs will improve the user experience which will result in a better overall product. Designing the software around the user needs will ensure the product stays relevant and more likely to be adopted by other users.   


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach was to have good plans (Design documents, UML Diagrams, ect) which alleviated a lot of future road bumps vs if I went in "winging" it. The design document made sure the requirements where in line with both the client's needs and the developers making the plans.
